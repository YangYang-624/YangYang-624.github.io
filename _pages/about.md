About me
------
I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position. I am a research assistant under the supervision of [Shuang Li](https://shuangli01.github.io/index.html) and will receive my Master's degree in Data Science from the Chinese University of Hong Kong(Shenzhen) in November 2024. Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Design Manufacturing and Its Automation from Beijing University of Chemical Technology in June 2022.

Research interests
------
My research interests lie in **trustworthy AI** and **explainable models**, particularly in utilizing **Neuro-Symbolic** and **differentiable rule learning** techniques to construct an AI Agent that encompasses knowledge collection, knowledge mining, and knowledge reasoning.

Hobbies
------
Running, cooking, reading, and researching traditional Chinese culture, such as Bazi and Feng Shui.
